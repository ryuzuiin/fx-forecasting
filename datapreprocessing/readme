It's about how you clean you data for regression models.

## 1.1 Pearson's Corrletion Coefficient
Before addressing missing values, I highly recommend performing some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) from a regression analysis perspective. For instance, you can start by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient for the entire dataset. By examining this coefficient, you can gain a preliminary understanding of the data inner correlation. In the context of finance, this analysis can also help you define your target.
